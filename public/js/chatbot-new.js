    stress: [
        "💙 I sense you're carrying weight right now, and I want you to know - that's okay. The fact that you recognize your stress shows real self-awareness. You're not weak for feeling this; you're human. Take a moment... breathe. What's one small thing you could do RIGHT NOW to ease just a tiny bit of this pressure? You don't have to fix it all at once.",
        "🌙 Stress whispers lies - it tells you that everything depends on you, that you must do it all perfectly. But here's the truth: you're enough, exactly as you are. Your worth isn't measured by productivity. Would it help to talk about what's making this feel so heavy? I'm here, and I care.",
        "✨ You're feeling the weight of responsibility, aren't you? That takes courage to admit. Stress is your mind's way of saying 'I need help' or 'I need rest'. Both are valid. Both are okay. What's ONE thing you could let go of, just for today? What's one promise you could break to yourself - a good promise to break?",
        "💝 Listen, what you're experiencing is real and it matters. But so do YOU. Your mental health is the foundation everything else is built on. If the foundation cracks, everything suffers. You matter more than any deadline, any task, any expectation. What would it take for you to put yourself first, even for just today?",
        "🌊 Stress can feel like drowning in waves. But here's what I know about waves - they always pass. They feel permanent when you're in them, but they move. You've survived 100% of your difficult days before this one. You're stronger than you know. Tell me - what's the ONE thing bothering you most right now?"
    ],
    anxious: [
        "💙 That racing heart, that spinning mind - I see you, and I want you to know you're safe right now. In THIS moment. Not in the future, not in the what-ifs. RIGHT NOW. You are safe. Your anxiety is trying to protect you, but it's being overprotective. You're more capable than anxiety says you are. Can we ground you? Notice 5 things you can see right now.",
        "🌟 Anxiety lies. It says 'something bad WILL happen' when the truth is 'something bad MIGHT happen, and I can handle it'. You've handled hard things before. You WILL handle hard things again. Your nervous system is just on high alert, but you can calm it. Want to try a breathing technique with me? I'm right here.",
        "✨ That feeling of losing control? It's anxiety's signature move. But here's the beautiful truth - you have more control than you think. You control your breath. You control what you focus on. You control whether you believe anxiety's stories. Right now, in this moment, you're okay. Will you trust me on that? What would help you feel even slightly more grounded?",
        "💜 I hear the worry in every word. And I want to tell you something important: worrying doesn't prevent bad things from happening. It just steals your peace. The worst thing you can do is already happening - you're suffering mentally. But I'm here with you. You don't have to white-knuckle your way through this alone.",
        "🌈 Anxiety is exhausting, isn't it? Constantly scanning for danger, preparing for the worst, imagining terrible scenarios. Your mind is trying SO HARD to protect you. But right now, in this safe moment, you can tell your mind 'thank you, I've got this.' You are SAFE. You are CAPABLE. You are WORTHY of peace."
    ],
    sad: [
        "💙 I can feel the heaviness in your words, and I want to wrap you in the warmest hug. Sadness means you're human, that something matters to you. You're allowed to feel this way. You don't have to be strong right now. You don't have to be 'fine'. You can just BE. What's breaking your heart right now? I'm listening.",
        "🌙 Sadness is nature's way of processing loss, change, disappointment. It's not weakness. It's actually beautiful - it shows how deeply you feel, how much you care. The depth of sadness sometimes means the depth of your capacity to love. This pain will ease. It won't always feel this heavy. But right now, it's okay to let yourself feel it.",
        "💜 You don't have to earn happiness by suffering. You don't have to 'get over it' quickly. Grief takes time. Sadness has its own timeline. The fact that you're reaching out shows you haven't given up, even when it feels dark. That takes incredible strength. What would bring you even a tiny moment of comfort right now? A favorite song? A warm drink? Time alone?",
        "✨ I see your pain, and I honor it. Sometimes sadness visits us and stays awhile. It's okay. You're not broken. You're not failing. You're just going through something hard. And you know what? You're still here. You're still trying. That's everything. Would it help to talk about what happened? Or would silence help more? You decide.",
        "🌈 This feeling won't last forever, even though it feels permanent. You've had dark days before and they've passed. Your resilience is deeper than you think. In fact, being able to feel sadness deeply shows how strong your heart is. Take gentle care of yourself. Sleep if you can. Eat if you can. Move gently. You're doing better than you think."
    ],
    work: [
        "💼 That work pressure is REAL. Your body is literally in stress mode right now. But I need you to hear this: your worth is NOT your work. You are valuable because you EXIST, not because of what you produce. The world doesn't need you to burn out. It needs you to be alive and well. What if you did LESS today? What if that was enough?",
        "🌟 Work is consuming you, and that's a sign something needs to change. Not in the work, but in your relationship with it. You have permission to set boundaries. 'No' is a complete sentence. 'I'm done for today' is valid. Your mental health is more important than being the 'perfect employee'. What boundary could you set TODAY?",
        "💙 The hustle culture lies to us. It says more work = more worth. But truth is: rest is productive. Rest is necessary. Rest is healthy. You're not lazy for needing breaks. You're human. Your body and mind are literally begging you to slow down. What would happen if you took one day - just ONE - where work didn't consume you?",
        "✨ I see how hard you're working, how much you're giving. But are you getting anything back? Time for yourself? Joy? Rest? Peace? A job is meant to serve your LIFE, not consume it. You matter more than your job title. You matter more than your to-do list. When was the last time you did something just for fun?",
        "🌊 Work stress is insidious because it creeps into every part of your life. It's there when you wake up, follows you to bed. But here's the thing - you CAN build a wall between work and life. You CAN take your time back. You CAN prioritize yourself. Your mental health is the most important job you have. Everything else comes second."
    ],
    study: [
        "📚 Those grades are NOT your worth. Your intelligence is NOT measured by test scores. Your value as a human being is intrinsic - it doesn't depend on academic performance. I know that's hard to believe when the pressure feels so real, but it's TRUE. What if you studied just for the JOY of learning, not for the grade? How would that feel?",
        "💜 Study pressure can feel suffocating, can't it? Like your entire future depends on this one exam. But it doesn't. You are so much more than your grades. You are a complete human with thoughts, feelings, dreams, humor, kindness. THOSE matter more than any A or test score. How can you be kinder to yourself while studying?",
        "✨ Your mental health is ACTUAL HEALTH. It's not a luxury. It's not something you do AFTER you ace the exam. It's something you do INSTEAD of sacrificing yourself for the exam. You cannot think clearly when you're burned out. You cannot learn effectively when you're anxious. Take care of yourself first. Your brain will thank you.",
        "🌟 I know the pressure feels enormous. But you're strong enough to handle this AND take care of yourself. You don't have to choose between success and wellness. You can have both. In fact, you're MORE likely to succeed when you're rested and calm. Take breaks. Rest. Move. These aren't procrastination - they're ESSENTIAL.",
        "💙 The world doesn't need another burned-out student. It needs YOU - whole, healthy, alive. It needs the full version of you, not the exhausted version. Study hard, yes. But also sleep hard. Rest hard. Play hard. Be kind to yourself. You're doing the best you can, and that's already more than enough."
    ],
    lonely: [
        "💙 That loneliness you're feeling is one of the realest, most painful human experiences. And I want you to know: you are NEVER truly alone. Loneliness is your heart's way of reaching out. And by reaching out here, you've already taken a brave step. You're worthy of connection. You're worthy of love. What does true connection look like to you?",
        "🌙 Loneliness doesn't mean you're unlovable. It means you're human and you crave connection - which is beautiful. But sometimes we feel alone even in crowds, or connected when we're by ourselves. What would true connection look like to you right now? Someone to listen? Someone to understand? I'm here, and I'm listening.",
        "✨ You matter. Your existence matters. Your thoughts, your feelings, your dreams - they all matter. The fact that you feel lonely shows you have capacity for love and connection. That's a gift, even though it hurts right now. Is there one person you could reach out to? Even a small, vulnerable message?",
        "💜 Sometimes loneliness is about being with people who don't SEE you. That's the deepest loneliness. You need people who GET you. People who celebrate you. And you deserve that. While you're finding those people, please know: I see you. Right here, right now. Your feelings are valid.",
        "🌈 Loneliness can feel permanent, but it's not. Connection is possible. YOU are possible. Someone would be lucky to know you. This moment of loneliness won't last forever. In the meantime, be your own best friend. Talk to yourself like you'd talk to someone you love. Because YOU are someone worth loving."
    ],
    tired: [
        "😴 That exhaustion? Your body is SCREAMING for help. It's not weakness - it's a signal that you need REST. Real, deep, guilt-free rest. Not productivity disguised as rest. Not 'self-care' that's another task. ACTUAL rest. Your body knows what it needs. Can you give it that? What does true rest look like for you?",
        "💙 Burnout is real, and it's serious. It's your body and mind saying 'STOP'. And you need to listen. Because pushing through will only make it worse. You're not lazy for being tired. You're not failing because you need rest. You're HUMAN. What's one thing you could stop doing today to create space for rest?",
        "✨ Fatigue is information. It's telling you something is unsustainable. Something needs to change. Not just tonight's sleep, but your whole life rhythm. What's draining you? What could you let go of? What could you delegate? What could you say NO to? Your energy is precious. Protect it.",
        "🌙 You've been running on empty, haven't you? Your cup is dry. But you can refill it. You CAN. You don't have to keep going. You're allowed to rest. You're allowed to slow down. You're allowed to stop. What would genuinely restore you? Not the advice in articles - what would YOUR soul find restoration in?",
        "💜 Please be gentle with yourself. Tiredness is telling you that you matter enough to need rest. That's beautiful. Honor that. Sleep when you can. Rest when you can. Move slowly. Let things be undone. Your wellbeing is more important than anyone's expectations of you."
    ],
    overwhelmed: [
        "🌊 You're drowning in too much at once, and that makes perfect sense. Your nervous system is overloaded. This isn't weakness. This is information. You have taken on TOO MUCH. And here's the beautiful thing: you can take some of it DOWN. Right now, what's the ONE thing that needs your attention most? Forget everything else for a moment.",
        "💙 Overwhelm is a sign that you need to PAUSE. Not push harder. Not do more. PAUSE. Take a breath. Step back. Look at what's actually in front of you versus what's in your head. Usually, what's actually here is manageable. It's what-ifs and futures that are overwhelming. Can we focus on right now?",
        "✨ You cannot do everything. You cannot be everything. And that's OKAY. You're one person. You have limits. Those limits aren't failures - they're FACTS. What if you picked THREE things to focus on and let the rest go? Not forever - just for now. What are those three things?",
        "🌟 Overwhelm whispers lies: 'You'll never catch up' 'It's all falling apart' 'You're failing'. But here's the truth: you're just one human trying to do multiple things. That's hard. That doesn't mean you're failing - it means you're at your limit. What could you ask for help with? What could someone else do?",
        "💜 I want you to know something: this feeling will pass. Overwhelm feels permanent but it's not. You WILL get through this. But not by pushing harder. By being strategic. By saying no. By asking for help. By letting go. What feels like the most urgent thing to let go of right now?"
    ],
    grateful: [
        "🌟 Your gratitude just warmed my heart! This is BEAUTIFUL! You're choosing to notice goodness even in hard times. That's wisdom. That's strength. Gratitude literally rewires your brain for more positivity. You're literally healing yourself right now. What else are you grateful for? Let's celebrate together!",
        "💛 Thank you for sharing this with me! In a world that loves to focus on what's wrong, YOU are choosing to celebrate what's right. That takes intentionality. That takes presence. Your positive energy is literally contagious. Keep nurturing that beautiful, grateful heart. The world needs more of this energy from you!",
        "🌈 I'm SO happy you're noticing the good things! Keep this energy. Gratitude is powerful medicine. Every time you notice something you're grateful for, you're training your brain to notice more good. You're literally rewiring yourself for joy. I'm proud of you for this.",
        "💙 Your gratitude shows such wisdom. You understand that joy isn't about perfect circumstances - it's about noticing the good within imperfect moments. That's enlightenment. That's peace. Please keep this practice alive. It's one of the most powerful tools you have.",
        "✨ I love this energy! This is the energy of someone who understands that gratitude is a superpower. Keep going. Notice more. Celebrate more. Share more. Your gratitude is changing your life and inspiring everyone around you."

        "🎉 YOUR JOY IS CONTAGIOUS! I'm literally so happy FOR you right now! This is wonderful! Soak in this feeling. Let it fill every cell of your body. THIS is what you deserve. THIS is possible for you. Remember this moment, hold it close. You are capable of joy. You ARE worthy of happiness!",
        "✨ I'm celebrating with you! This happiness you're feeling - HOLD IT. Remember what it feels like. Remember what led to it. Happiness isn't a permanent state, but it's POSSIBLE. You've proven it. Now you know: you CAN feel this good. You WILL feel this good again. Celebrate YOU!",
        "💜 This is the most beautiful energy! Your happiness is literally lighting up my screen right now. Keep this. Protect this. Notice what's creating this joy and do MORE of it. You deserve this feeling. You DESERVE this happiness. I'm so incredibly proud of you right now.",
        "🌈 YES! THIS is what I want for you! Happiness, joy, lightness. You're ALLOWED to feel this good. You don't have to apologize for it. You don't have to downplay it. OWN it. You did this. Your choices, your perspective, your strength - they created this happiness. You're incredible!",
        "💙 I'm so moved by your joy! This is real. This is YOURS. This proves something important: even when life is hard, happiness is still possible. You can feel this good again. Whenever you're struggling, remember: you felt this happy once. You WILL feel this happy again. This is your proof."

        "✨ Thank you for trusting me with this. I can tell something important is happening for you right now. I want to understand more. What does this mean to you? Why does it matter so much? I'm listening with all my attention.",
