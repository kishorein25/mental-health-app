- Movement to release what hurts
- Films that show you're not alone
- Games to ground yourself
- Binaural beats to heal your nervous system
- A chatbot that understands abuse and trauma

**You matter. Your pain is real. Healing is possible.**

Start with what calls to you. Maybe it's the music. Maybe the chatbot. Maybe the movement. There's no "right" way - just YOUR way.

**You've got this. I'm here for you. 💙**
